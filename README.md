# small description

A small Debian package for manual or automatic installation and configuration, Package for Debian-based distros

# Notes For Arm64 and I386 processor

- As it is an emulated cpu, in this package we have to be patient in waiting for the software to `get` to start the map, and we will have several time outs because of that
- I recommend it only for tests not for daily use (I already got several maps because of that)

# Tested where!

- Linux Deploy (Motorola Moto G7 Plus - Root)
- RespBerry pi 3B+
- VM Azure (Ubuntu Server 18.04 Amd64)
